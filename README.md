### Hello :grin:

My name is Guilherme Nascimento and I live in Brazil (🇧🇷). Currently working as a full stack developer (PHP, Laravel, Node.js and Vuejs) in a company that focuses on email, SMS and transactional SMTP distribution tools.

Currently specializing in iOS app development with Swift/SwiftUI at Stanford (👨🏻‍💻📲).

It is a course provided free of charge by Stanford. Below are the links to the repository where I record the progress of the course and also the course page:

Github repository: <https://github.com/gfnasc/stanford-CS193p-dev-ios>

In my spare time I really enjoy playing musical instruments and recording videos to post on my networks (🎸🎥). I currently play guita, bass and drums. The next instrument I will learn will be the Violin.
