### Hello :grin:

My name is Guilherme Nascimento and I live in Brazil (🇧🇷). Currently working as a front-end engineer in a company that focuses on unite global markets.

Currently specializing in JavaScript, Vuejs, TailwindCSS, etc.

In my spare time I really enjoy playing musical instruments and recording videos to post on my networks (🎸🎥). I currently play guitar, bass, ukulele and drums. The next instrument I will learn will be the Violin.
